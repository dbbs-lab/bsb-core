Adding morphologies
===================

.. note::

    This guide is a continuation of the |:books:| :doc:`Getting Started guide </getting-started/getting-started>`.

.. hint::

    To follow along, download 2 morphologies from
    `NeuroMorpho <https://neuromorpho.org/>`_ and save them as ``neuron_A.swc`` and
    ``neuron2.swc`` locally.

Previously we constructed a stacked double layer topology, with 2 cell types. We then
connected them in an all-to-all fashion. The next step assigns
:doc:`morphologies </morphologies/intro>` to our cells, and connects the cells based on
the intersection of their morphologies!

Morphologies can be loaded from local files or to fetch from remote sources, like NeuroMorpho.

Using local files
-----------------

You can declare source morphologies in the root :guilabel:`morphologies` list:

.. tab-set-code::

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 9-10

  .. code-block:: json

       "morphologies": [
         "neuron_A"
       ],

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 18,19,21

In this case a morphology is created from ``neuron_A.swc`` and given the name ``"neuron_A"``.
As a second step, we associate this morphology to the ``base_type`` by referencing it by name
in :guilabel:`cell_types.base_type.spatial.morphologies`:

.. tab-set-code::

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 30-36
    :emphasize-lines: 6-7

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.json
    :language: json
    :lines: 41-50
    :emphasize-lines: 6-8

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 23


By default the name assigned to the morphology is the file name without its extension (here ``.swc``). To
change the name we can use a node with a :guilabel:`name` and :guilabel:`file`:

.. tab-set-code::

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 9-12
    :emphasize-lines: 3-4

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.json
    :language: json
    :lines: 12-17
    :emphasize-lines: 4-5

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 18-21
    :emphasize-lines: 3

It is also possible to add a pipeline to perform transformations on the loaded
morphology. Pipelines can be added by adding a :guilabel`pipeline` list to the morphology node.
Each item in the list may either be a string reference to an importable function or a method of
the :class:`~bsb.morphologies.Morphology` class. To pass parameters, use a node with the
function reference placed in the guilabel:`func` attribute, and a :guilabel:`parameters` list.
Here is an example what that would look like:

.. tab-set-code::

  .. code-block:: yaml

    morphologies:
      - file: my_neuron.swc
        pipeline:
          - center
          - my_module.add_axon
          - func: rotate
            parameters:
              - [20, 0, 20]

  .. code-block:: json

    "morphologies": [
      {
        "file": "my_neuron.swc",
        "pipeline": [
          "center",
          "my_module.add_axon",
          {
            "func": "rotate",
            "rotation": [20, 0, 20]
          },
        ],
      }
    ]

.. note::

  Any additional keys given in a pipeline step, such as :guilabel:`rotation` in the
  example, are passed to the function as keyword arguments.

Fetching with alternative URI schemes
-------------------------------------

The framework uses URI schemes to define the path of the sources that are loaded. By
default it tries to load from the project local folder, using the``file`` URI scheme (``"file://"``).
It is possible to fetch morphologies directly from `neuromorpho.org
<https://neuromorpho.org>`_ using the NeuroMorpho scheme (``"nm://"``). You can refer to
NeuroMorpho morphologies by their morphology name:

.. figure:: /images/nm_what.png
  :figwidth: 450px
  :align: center

.. tab-set-code::

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 9-12
    :emphasize-lines: 3-4

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.json
    :language: json
    :lines: 12-22,41-61
    :emphasize-lines: 7-10,27-28

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 25-36
    :emphasize-lines: 2,10


Morphology intersection
-----------------------

Now that we have assigned morphologies to our cell types, we can use morphology-based
connection strategies such as :class:`~.connectivity.detailed.voxel_intersection.VoxelIntersection`:

.. tab-set-code::

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 56-64

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.json
    :language: json
    :lines: 74-84

  .. literalinclude:: include_morphos.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 43-48

.. note::

  If there's multiple morphologies per cell type, they'll be assigned randomly, unless you
  specify a :class:`~.placement.distributor.MorphologyDistributor`.
