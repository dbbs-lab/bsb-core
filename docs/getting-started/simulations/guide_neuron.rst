################################
Run your first NEURON simulation
################################

In this example we are going to present how to configure a simulation of a multi-compartment neurons network.
To proceed, please install the following additional packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install bsb-neuron[parallel]
    pip install dbbs-catalogue

For this example, we will build a network consisting of a layer of mouse
stellate cells connected through axon-dendrite overlap, using the strategy :doc:`VoxelIntersection </connectivity/connection-strategies>`.
The morphology of a custom stellate cell is provided :download:`here </getting-started/data/StellateCell.swc>`.

The network configuration should be as follows:

.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: /getting-started/configs/guide-neuron.json
      :language: json
      :lines: 1-71

    .. literalinclude:: /../examples/tutorials/neuron-simulation.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 1-54

Now we have to configure the simulation block.
Let's start by configuring the global simulation parameters: first of all
define a :guilabel:`simulator`, then you need to define the :guilabel:`resolution`
(the time step of the simulation in milliseconds),
the :guilabel:`duration` (the total length of the simulation in milliseconds) and
the :guilabel:`temperature` (celsius unit).

.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: /getting-started/configs/guide-neuron.json
      :language: json
      :lines: 72-76

    .. literalinclude:: /../examples/tutorials/neuron-simulation.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 56-61

Cell Models
-----------

For each **cell type** population in your network, you must assign a **NEURON model** to define the cell's behavior. This model
encapsulates all the specifications for ion channels and synapses covering all components of the cell..
Within a model the synapse parameters are defined in the :guilabel:`synapse_types` attribute, while the
parameters for ion channel mechanisms are defined in :guilabel:`cable_types`. A detailed discussion of model
characteristics is beyond the scope of this guide; therefore, a ready-to-use Stellate model is provided
:download:`here </getting-started/data/Stellate.py>`.

Save the Stellate.py file in your project folder and review its contents.
Inside, you will find a model definition called
:guilabel:`definitionStellate`, which includes all the customized parameters.
This is the object you will reference in your configuration.

.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: /getting-started/configs/guide-neuron.json
      :language: json
      :lines: 79-83

    .. literalinclude:: /../examples/tutorials/neuron-simulation.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 62-64

Connection Models
-----------------

For each connection type of your network, you also need to define a model describing its synapses' dynamics.
Similar to the :guilabel:`cell_models` block, each :guilabel:`connection_model` you define should use a key
that corresponds to a ``ConnectivitySet`` created during reconstruction (as explained in the previous
:doc:`section </getting-started/getting-started_reconstruction>`).
In this example we have only the :guilabel:`stellate_to_stellate` connection, where we assign the synapses
defined in the model file, namely :guilabel:`AMPA`, :guilabel:`GABA`, and :guilabel:`NMDA`.

.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: /getting-started/configs/guide-neuron.json
      :language: json
      :lines: 84-91

    .. literalinclude:: /../examples/tutorials/neuron-simulation.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 65-73

At all the synapses is assigned a :guilabel:`weight` of 0.001 and a :guilabel:`delay` (ms) of 1.

Devices
-------

In the :guilabel:`devices` block, include all interfaces you wish to use for interacting with the network.
These devices correspond typically to stimulators and measurement instruments.

In this example, a :guilabel:`spike_generator` is used to stimulate the cell with ID 0,
starting at 9 ms, with 1 spike. The stimulus targets the dendrites through AMPA and NMDA synapses.
The membrane potential is recorded using a :guilabel:`voltage_recorder`, which collects the
signal from within a 600 Âµm radius sphere. Synapse activity is monitored with a :guilabel:`synapse_recorder`
for the :guilabel:`AMPA` and :guilabel:`NMDA` synapses on the cell's dendrites,
within the same spherical region.

.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: /getting-started/configs/guide-neuron.json
      :language: json
      :lines: 92-136

    .. literalinclude:: /../examples/tutorials/neuron-simulation.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 74-107

Final configuration file
------------------------

.. tab-set-code::


  .. literalinclude:: /getting-started/configs/guide-neuron.json
    :language: json

  .. literalinclude:: /../examples/tutorials/neuron-simulation.py
    :language: python

Running the Simulation
----------------------

Simulations are separated from the reconstruction pipeline (see the
:doc:`top level guide </getting-started/top-level-guide>`),
which means you do not need to recompile your network to add a simulation to your stored Configuration.
In this example, we only modified the ``Configuration`` in the :guilabel:`simulations` block but this updates were
not been saved in the network file.
So, you need to update your file, using either the ``reconfigure`` command or the ``store_active_config`` method.

.. tab-set-code::

  .. code-block:: bash

    bsb reconfigure network.hdf5 network_configuration.json

  .. code-block:: python

    storage = scaffold.storage
    storage.store_active_config(config)

Once this is done, create a folder in which to store your simulation results:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir simulation-results

You can now run your simulation:

.. tab-set-code::

  .. code-block:: bash

    bsb simulate my_network.hdf5 basal_activity -o simulation-results

  .. code-block:: python

        from bsb import from_storage

        scaffold = from_storage("my_network.hdf5")
        result = scaffold.run_simulation("basal_activity")
        result.write("simulation-results/basal_activity.nio", "ow")

The results of the simulation will be stored in the ``"simulation-results"`` folder.

.. note::
    If you run the simulation with the command line interface, the name of the output nio file is randomized by BSB.
