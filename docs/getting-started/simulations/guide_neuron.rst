################################
Run your first NEURON simulation

.. note::

    This guide is a continuation of the
    :doc:`Morphology guide <include_morphos>`.

In this tutorial, we assume that you have successfully reconstructed a network with BSB.
We will now guide you through the process of configuring a simulation with BSB for your network.

Let's start by configuring the global simulation parameters.
These include the :guilabel:`simulator` to be used. BSB supports the following simulators:

- `NEST simulator <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
- `NEURON simulator <https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/>`_
- `ARBOR simulator <https://arbor-sim.org/>`_
