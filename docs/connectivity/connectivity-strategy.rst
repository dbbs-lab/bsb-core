Connectivity strategy
#####################

:light-bulb: Make sure to read the :ref:`Writing Components <components>` section first.

:class:`~bsb.connectivity.strategy.ConnectionStrategy` is a component that defines how to
connect one or more presynaptic cell types to one or more postsynaptic cell types.
Connection strategies are :ref:`configured <files>` in the :guilabel:`connectivity` block.
For example suppose we are writing a cerebellum module and that we are defining a
connection strategy ``ConnectomeGolgiGranule`` to connect Golgi cells to granule cells in
the Python module ``cerebellum/connectome/golgi_granule.py``. Suppose that up to 40
granule cells can be connected to a Golgi cell and that a connection can be formed only if
the somata of two cells are less than 100 micrometers away. In the case in which more than
40 cells meet the conditions, we take the 40 closer ones.

.. code-block:: json
  
  "golgi_to_granule": {
        "strategy": "cerebellum.connectome.golgi_granule.ConnectomeGolgiGranule",
        "radius": 100,
        "convergence": 40,
        "presynaptic": {
          "cell_types": ["golgi_cell"]
        },
        "postsynaptic": {
          "cell_types": ["granule_cell"]
        }
      }

The prototype of a custom connection strategy is the following:

.. code-block:: python

  # We import the base class ConnectionStrategy
  from bsb.strategy import ConnectionStrategy
  # We import config to read the variables from the configuration file
  from bsb import config
  # We import numpy because we shall use it to perform the math operations 
  # need to select the cells to connect.
  import numpy as np

  class ConnectomeGolgiGranule(ConnectionStrategy):
    
    def get_region_of_interest(self, chunk):
      # For a given chunk this method returns a list of chunks in which to look for postsynaptic cells. 
      pass

    def connect(self, pre, post):
      # Here goes the code that selects the cells to connect
      # The information about the connections to be formed are stored
      # in two matrices to be passed to the connect connect_cells method,
      # to be called at the end. 
      pass

.. note::
  Due to performance and memory reasons, the connections are not formed processing the whole simulation volume at once, since it would require a lot of memory, time and computational power. Instead, the volume is divided in chunks, which may be processed in parallel to further speed up the creation of the connectome, and the connections are formed on a chunk by chunk basis. This step is handles by the :meth:`~.bsb.connectivity.strategy.ConnectionStrategy.queue` method of the base class :class:`~bsb.connectivity.strategy.ConnectionStrategy` : The user writing a custom connection strategy does not need to care about the subdivision in chucks, since it is handled automatically by the framework. 

.. note::
  By default a single presyptic-chunk is associated with many post-synaptic chunks as dictated by ``get_region_of_interest``. Therefore, the argument ``post`` contains the data about the postsynaptic cells in the chunks inside the region of interest (ROI), while ``pre`` contains data about the presynaptic cells of a single chunk. 
  However, when writing a custom connection strategy it may be useful to do the opposite, namely to associate a single post-synaptic chunk to many pre-synaptic chunks, an example being the connection between mossy fibers and glomeruli, for which we need to make sure that each glomerulus is associated to one and only one mossy fiber. 
  This can be done by inheriting from :class:`bsb.mixins.InvertedRoI`. In this case, the ``pre`` argument will contain a RoI consisting of multiple presynaptic chunks, and the ``post`` argument will contain a RoI of just 1 postsynaptic chunk.

  .. code-block:: python
  
    from bsb.mixins import InvertedRoI
    
    class MyConnStrategy(InvertedRoI, ConnectionStrategy):
      pass

:meth:`~bsb.connectivity.strategy.ConnectionStrategy.get_region_of_interest`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this method is to find all the chunks in the simulation volume containing all the possibile the postsynaptic cells of the presynaptic cells in the chunk given as argument.

:meth:`~bsb.connectivity.strategy.ConnectionStrategy.connect`
-------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments: ``pre`` and ``post`` are :class:`HemitypeCollections <bsb.connectivity.strategy.HemitypeCollection>`. ``pre`` contains the presynaptic cell collection and ``post`` contains the postsynaptic cell collection in the region of interest.

.. note::
  Inside of the ``connect`` method, try to exclusively perform the mathematical operations required to determine the connectivity matrix.

The connection between two types of cells is made calling ``self.connect_cells``.
``connect_cells`` needs four arguments:

* ``pre_set`` : A numpy array containing the positions of the presynaptic cells.
* ``post_set`` : A numpy array containing the positions of the postsynaptic cells.
* ``src_locs`` : A nx3 matrix, with n the number of connections, containing information
   about where the connection starts. Each row of the matrix contains three integers
   (a,b,c), with a the index of the presynaptic cell, b the index of the branch on which
   a connection is made and c the index (relative to a branch) of the point at which the
   connection starts.

* ``dest_locs`` : A nx3 matrix,with n the number of connections, containing information
   about where the connection ends. Each row of the matrix contains three integers
   (a,b,c), with a the index of the postsynaptic cell, b the index of the branch on which
   a connection is made and c the index (relative to a branch) of the point at which the
   connection ends. The k-th row of src_locs describes the beginning of the k-th
   connection on the presynaptic cell, while the k-th row of dest_locs stores the info
   about the end of the k-th connection on the postsynaptic cell.

 * ``tag`` : a tag describing the connection (optional, defaults to the strategy name, or
   `f"{name}_{pre}_to_{post}"` when multiple cell types are combined).


For example, if ``src_locs`` and ``dest_locs`` are the following matrices:

.. list-table:: src_locs
   :widths: 75 75 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Index of the cell in pre_pos array
     - Index of the branch at which the connection starts
     - Index of the point on the branch at which the connection starts.
   * - 2
     - 0
     - 6
   * - 10
     - 0
     - 2
   

.. list-table:: dest_locs
   :widths: 75 75 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Index of the cell in post_pos array
     - Index of the branch at which the connecion ends.
     - Index of the point on the branch at which the connection ends.
   * - 5
     - 1
     - 3
   * - 7
     - 1
     - 4

then two connections are formed:

* The first connection is formed between the presynaptic cell whose index in ``pre_pos``
   is ``2`` and the postsynaptic cell whose index in ``post_pos`` is ``10``.

Furthermore, the connection begins at the point with id ``6`` on the branch whose id is
   ``0`` on the presynaptic cell and ends on the points with id ``3`` on the branch whose
   id is ``1`` on the postsynaptic cell.

* The second connection is formed between the presynaptic cell whose index in ``pre_pos``
   is ``10`` and the postsynaptic cell whose index in ``post_pos`` is ``7``. Furthermore,
   the connection begins at the point with id ``3`` on the branch whose id is ``0`` on the
   presynaptic cell and ends on the points with id ``4`` on the branch whose id is ``1``
   on the postsynaptic cell.

.. note::
  If the exact location of a synaptic connection is not needed, then in both ``src_locs``
  and ``dest_locs`` the indices of the branches and of the point on the branch can be set
  to ``-1``.

Use case 1 : Connect point-like cells 
=====================================
Suppose we want to connect Golgi cells and granule cells, without storing information about the exact positions of the synapses (we may want to consider cells as point-like objects, as in NEST).
We want to write a class called ``ConnectomeGolgiGranule`` that connects a Golgi cell to a granule cell if their distance is less than 100 micrometers (see the configuration block above). 

First we define the class ``ConnectomeGolgiGlomerulus`` and we specify that we require to be configured with a :guilabel:`radius` and :guilabel:`divergence` attribute.

.. code-block:: python

  @config.node
  class ConnectomeGolgiGlomerulus(ConnectionStrategy):
      # Read vars from the configuration file
      radius = config.attr(type=int, required=True)
      divergence = config.attr(type=int, required=True)

Now we need to write the ``get_region_of_interest`` method.
For a given chunk we want all the neighbouring chunks in which we can find the presynaptic cells at less than 50 micrometers.
Such cells are contained for sure in the chunks which are less than 50 micrometers away from the current chunk.

.. code-block:: python

    def get_region_of_interest(self, chunk):
      # We get the ConnectivitySet of golgi_to_granule
      cs = self.network.get_connectivity_set(tag="golgi_to_granule")
      # We get the coordinates of all the chunks
      chunks = ct.get_placement_set().get_all_chunks()
      # We define an empty list in which we shall add the chunks of interest
      selected_chunks = []
      # We look for chunks which are less than radius away from the current one
      for c in chunks:    
        dist = np.sqrt(
          np.power((chunk[0] - c[0]) * chunk.dimensions[0], 2)
            + np.power((chunk[1]  - c[1]) * chunk.dimensions[1], 2)
            + np.power((chunk[2]  - c[2]) * chunk.dimensions[2], 2)
        )
        # We select only the chunks satisfying the condition
        if (dist < self.radius):
            selected_chunks.append(Chunk([c[0], c[1], c[2]], chunk.dimensions))
      return selected_chunks
    
Now we're ready to write the ``connect`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    def connect(self, pre, post):
      # This strategy connects every combination pair of the configured presynaptic to postsynaptic cell types.
      # We will tackle each pair's connectivity inside of our own `_connect_type` helper method.
      for pre_ct, pre_ps in pre.placement.items():
          for post_ct, post_ps in post.placement.items():
              # The hemitype collection's `placement` is a dictionary mapping each cell type to a placement set with all
              # cells being processed in this parallel job. So call our own `_connect_type` method with each pre-post combination
              self._connect_type(pre_ct, pre_ps, post_ct, post_ps)

      def _connect_type(self, pre_ct, pre_ps, post_ct, post_ps):
        # This is the inner function that calculates the connectivity matrix for a pre-post cell type pair
        # We start by loading the cell position matrices (Nx3)
        golgi_pos = pre_ps.load_positions()
        granule_pos = post_ps.load_positions()
        n_glomeruli = len(glomeruli_pos)
        n_golgi = len(golgi_pos)
        n_conn = n_glomeruli * n_golgi
        # For the sake of speed we define two arrays pre_locs and post_locs of length n_conn 
        # (the maximum number of connections which can be made) to store the connections information, 
        # even if we will not use all the entries of arrays.
        # We keep track of how many entries we actually employ, namely how many connection
        # we made, using the variable ptr. For example if we formed 4 connections the useful 
        # data lie in the first 4 elements
        pre_locs = np.full((n_conn, 3), -1, dtype=int)
        post_locs = np.full((n_conn, 3), -1, dtype=int)
        ptr = 0
        # We select the cells to connect according to our connection rule.
        for i, golgi in enumerate(golgi_pos):
          # We compute the distance between the current Golgi cell and all the granule cells in the region of interest.
          dist = np.sqrt(
                      np.power(golgi[0] - granule_pos[0], 2)
                      + np.power(golgi[1] - granule_pos[1], 2)
                      + np.power(golgi[2] - granule_pos[2], 2)
                  )
          # We select all the granule cells which are less than 100 micrometers away up to the divergence value.
          # For the sake of simplicity in this example we assume to find at least 40 candidates satisfying the condition.
          granule_close_enough = dist < self.radius
          
          # We find the indices of the 40 closest granule cells
          to_connect_ids = np.argsort(granule_close_enough)[0:self.divergence]

          # Since we are interested in connecting point-like cells, we do not need to store
          # info about the precise position on the dendrites or axons; 
          # It is enough to store which presynaptic cell is connected to
          # certain postsynaptic cells, namely the first entry of both `pre_set` and `post_set`.
          
          # The index of the presynaptic cell in the `golgi_pos` array is `i`
          pre_set[ptr:ptr+self.divergence,0] = i
          # We store in post_set the indices of the postsynaptic cells we selected before.
          post_set[ptr:ptr+self.divergence,0] = to_connect_ids
          ptr += to_be_connected

        # Now we connect the cells according to the information stored in `src_locs` and `dest_locs`
        # calling the `connect_cells` method.
        self.connect_cells(pre_set, post_set, src_locs, dest_locs)

Use case 2 : Connection between a detailed cell and a point-like cell. 
======================================================================

If we have a detailed morphology of the pre- or postsynaptic cells we can specify where to form the connection. Suppose we want to connect Golgi cells to glomeruli specifying the position of the connection on the Golgi cell axon. In this example we form a connection on the closest point to a glomerulus.
First, we need to specify the type of neurites that we want to consider on the morphologies when forming synapses. We can do this in the configuration file, using the :guilabel:`morphology_labels` attribute on the `connectivity.*.postsynaptic` (or `presynaptic`) node:

.. code-block:: json
  
  "golgi_to_granule": {
        "strategy": "cerebellum.connectome.golgi_granule.ConnectomeGolgiGranule",
        "radius": 100,
        "convergence": 40,
        "presynaptic": {
          "cell_types": ["glomerulus"]
        },
        "postsynaptic": {
          "cell_types": ["golgi_cell"],
          "morphology_labels" : ["basal_dendrites"]
        }
      }

The :meth:`~bsb.connectivity.strategy.ConnectionStrategy.get_region_of_interest` is analogous to the previous example, so we focus only on the :meth:`~bsb.connectivity.strategy.ConnectionStrategy.connect` method.

.. code-block:: python

    def connect(self, pre, post):
      for pre_ct, pre_ps in pre.placement.items():
          for post_ct, post_ps in post.placement.items():
              self._connect_type(pre_ct, pre_ps, post_ct, post_ps)
  
      def _connect_type(self, pre_ct, pre_ps, post_ct, post_ps):
        # We store the positions of the pre and post synaptic cells.
        golgi_pos = pre_ps.load_positions()
        glomeruli_pos = post_ps.load_positions()
        n_glomeruli = len(glomeruli_pos)
        n_golgi = len(golgi_pos)
        max_conn = n_glomeruli * n_golgi
        # We define two arrays of length `max_conn ` to store the connections,
        # even if we will not use all the entries of arrays, for the sake of speed.
        pre_locs = np.full((max_conn , 3), -1, dtype=int)
        post_locs = np.full((max_conn , 3), -1, dtype=int)
        # `ptr` keeps track of how many connections we've made so far.
        ptr = 0
      
        # Cache morphologies and generate the morphologies iterator.
        morpho_set = post_ps.load_morphologies()
        golgi_morphos = morpho_set.iter_morphologies(cache=True, hard_cache=True)
        
        # Loop through all the Golgi cells
        for i, golgi, morpho in zip(itertools.count(), golgi_pos, golgi_morphos):
            
            # We compute the distance between the current Golgi cell and all the glomeruli,
            # then select the good ones.
            dist = np.sqrt(
                np.power(golgi[0] - glomeruli_pos[:, 0], 2)
                + np.power(golgi[1] - glomeruli_pos[:, 1], 2)
                + np.power(golgi[2] - glomeruli_pos[:, 2], 2)
