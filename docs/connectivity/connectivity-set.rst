Connectivity sets
=================

Connectivity sets store the connections between a single presynaptic and postsynaptic cell
types. Multiple connectivity sets between the same cell types can exist under different
*tags*. These tags are the unique identifier of each connectivity set and how you usually
refer to them elsewhere in the framework.
