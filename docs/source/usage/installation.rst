The scaffold framework can be installed using Pip for Python 3

  .. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install bsb

You can verify that the installation works with

  .. code-block:: bash

    bsb -v=3 compile -x=200 -z=200 -p

This should generate an HDF5 file in your current directory and open a plot of
the generated network. If everything looks fine you are ready to advance to
the next topic.
