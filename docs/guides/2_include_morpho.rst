Including morphologies
======================

After the :doc:`/usage/getting-started` you have:

* 1 region: ``brain_region``
* 2 partitions: ``base_layer`` and ``top_layer``
* 2 cell types ``base_type`` and ``top_type``

The cell types are placed and connected, but they're connected all-to-all. Let's include
some morphologies to make things more interesting.
