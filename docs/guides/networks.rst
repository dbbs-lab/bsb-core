Using networks
==============

Greetings traveller, it seems you've created a network. Network files contain:

* The configuration used to create them, so also all component definitions like cell
  types, topology, placement and connectivity blocks, and simulation config.

* The morphologies that may be assigned to cells, their labels and properties.
* The placement data such as positions, rotations, assigned morphologies and user-defined
  additional data.

* The connectivity data that specifies which cells are connected, and the properties of
  those connections.

Here are some examples to help you on your way.
