######################
Command Line Interface
######################

There are 2 entry points in the command line interface:

* **A command**: Can be written in a command line prompt such as the Terminal on
  Linux or CMD on Windows.
* **The shell**: Can be opened by giving typing ``bsb`` into a command line
  prompt.

**************
Scaffold shell
**************

The scaffold shell is an interactive environment where commands can be given.
Unlike with the command line your state is maintained in between commands.

Opening the shell
=================

Open your favorite command line prompt and if the scaffold package is succesfully
installed the ``bsb`` command should be available.

You can close the shell by typing ``exit``.

The base state
==============

After opening the shell it will be in the base (default) state. In this state
you have access to several commands like opening morphology repositories or hdf5
files.

List of base commands
---------------------

* ``open mr <filename>``: Open a morphology repository. See :ref:`repl_mr_commands`
* ``open hdf5 <filename>``: Open an HDF5 file. See :ref:`repl_hdf5_commands`

The morphology repository state
===============================

In this state you can modify the morphology repository.
After you've opened a repository the shell will display a prefix::

  repo <filename>:

.. _repl_mr_commands:

List of mr commands
-------------------

* ``list all``: Show a list of all morphologies available in the repository.
* ``list voxelized``: Show a list of all morphologies with voxel cloud
  information available.
* ``import repo <filename>``: Import all morphologies from another repository.
  ``-f``/``--overwrite``: Overwrite existing morphologies.
* ``import swc <file> <name>``: Import an SWC morphology and store it under the
  given name.
* ``arborize <class> <name>``: Import an Arborize model.
* ``remove <name>``: Remove a morphology from the repository.
* ``voxelize <name> [<n=130>]``: Generate a voxel cloud of ``n`` (optional,
  default=130) voxels for the morphology.
* ``plot <name>``: Plot the morphology.
* ``close``: Exit the mr state.

The HDF5 state
==============

In this state you can view the structure of HDF5 files.

.. _repl_hdf5_commands:

List of hdf5 commands:
----------------------

* ``view``: Create a hierarchical print of the HDF5 file, groups, datasets, and
  attributes.

* ``plot``: Display a plot of the HDF5 network.

.. note::
  Parameters included between square brackets are optional, the brackets need
  not be included in the actual command.

compile
=======

``bsb [-v=1 -c=mouse_cerebellum] compile [-p -o]``

Compiles a network architecture: Places cells in a simulated volume and connects
them to eachother. All this information is then stored in a single HDF5 file.

.. include:: commands_defaults.txt

* ``-p``: Plot the created network.
* ``-o=<file>``, ``--output=<file>``: Output the result to a specific file.

simulate
========

``bsb [-v=1] simulate <name> [-rc=<config>] --hdf5=<file>``

Run a simulation from a compiled network architecture.

.. include:: commands_defaults.txt

* ``name``: Name of the simulation.
* ``--hdf5``: Path to the compiled network architecture.
* ``-rc``, ``--reconfigure``: The path to a new configuration file for the HDF5
  file.

run
===

``bsb [-v=1 -c=mouse_cerebellum] run <name> [-p]``

Run a simulation creating a new network architecture.

.. include:: commands_defaults.txt

* ``-p``: Plot the created network.

plot
====

``bsb plot <file>``

Create a plot of the network in an HDF5 file.
