# BSB: A scaffold modelling framework
This package is intended to facilitate spatially, topologically and morphologically
detailed simulations of brain regions developed by the Department of Brain and
Behavioral Sciences at the University of Pavia.

## Installation

The BSB requires Python 3.8+.

### pip

This software can be installed as a Python package from PyPI through pip:

```
pip install "bsb>=4.0.0a0"
```

### Developers

Developers best use pip's *editable* install. This creates a live link between the
installed package and the local git repository:

```
 git clone git@github.com:dbbs-lab/bsb
 cd bsb
 pip install -e .[dev]
 pre-commit install
```

## Usage

The scaffold framework is best used in a project context. Create a working directory for
each of your modelling projects and use the command line to configure, reconstruct or
simulate your models.

### Creating a project

You can create boilerplate projects using:

```
bsb new
```

It will ask you some information about the project, like a name and configuration template
and set up the most suited directory structure and key files for you. Afterwards, `cd`
into your project folder:

```
cd my_model
```

### Reconstructing a network

You can use your project to create reconstructions of your model, generating cell positions
and connections:

```
bsb compile -p
```

This should create a network file and plot the network.

### Simulating a network

The default project currently contains no simulation config.

# Contributing

All contributions are very much welcome.
Take a look at the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Known issues

## Simulation interfaces are not reinstated yet in v4

Shouldn't be much work, famous last words.
