deadlines and will be solved at a later date.

# Scaffold: A scaffold model for the cerebellum
This package is intended to facilitate spatially, topologically and morphologically
detailed simulations of the cerebellum developed by the Department of Brain and Behavioral
Sciences at the University of Pavia.

## Installation

### pip

This software can be installed as a Python package from PyPI through pip:

```
pip install bsb
```

**Note:** *Windows users will have to install Rtree from this website:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#rtree*

### Developers

Developers best use pip's *editable* install. This creates a live link between the
installed package and the local git repository:

```
 git clone git@github.com:Helveg/cerebellum-scaffold.git
 cd cerebellum-scaffold
 pip install -e .[dev]
 pre-commit install
```

## Usage

The scaffold model can be used through the command line interface or as a python package.

### Command line interface (CLI)

Run the scaffold in the command line with subcommand `compile` to compile a network
architecture.

```
scaffold --config=mouse_cerebellum_cortex_noTouch.json compile -x=200 -z=200 -p
```

To run with different configurations, change the config argument to the relative path of a
.json config file. The `-p` flag indicates that the compiled network should be plotted
afterwards and can be omitted.

### Python package

The central object is the `bsb.core.Scaffold` class. This object requires a
`bsb.config.ScaffoldConfig` instance for its construction. To emulate the CLI
functionality you can use the `JSONConfig` class and provide the relative path to the
configuration file.

```python
from bsb import Scaffold
from bsb.config import JSONConfig

config = new JSONConfig(file='mouse_cerebellum_cortex_noTouch.json')
scaffoldInstance = new Scaffold(config)
```

This scaffold instance can then be used to perform the subcommands available in the CLI by
calling their corresponding functions:

```python
scaffoldInstance.compile_network()
```

#### Plotting network architecture

After calling `compile_network` the scaffold instance can be plotted:

```python
scaffoldInstance.plot_network_cache()
```


# Known issues

## No configuration serialization

When modifying the config object through scripts and then saving it to file, you'll store
the original configuration file text, and you won't actually serialize the modified object

We will fix this by version 3.2
