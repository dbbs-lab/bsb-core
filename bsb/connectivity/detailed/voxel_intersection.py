    This strategy voxelizes morphologies into collections of cubes, thereby reducing
    the spatial specificity of the provided traced morphologies by grouping multiple
    compartments into larger cubic voxels. Intersections are found not between the
    seperate compartments but between the voxels and random compartments of matching
    voxels are connected to eachother. This means that the connections that are made
    are less specific to the exact morphology and can be very useful when only 1 or a
    few morphologies are available to represent each cell type.
