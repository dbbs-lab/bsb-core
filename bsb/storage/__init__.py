"""
    This module imports all supported storage engines, objects that read and write data,
    which are present as subfolders of the `engine` folder, and provides them
    transparently to the user, as a part of the :class:`Storage <.storage.Storage>`
    factory class. The module scans the :module:`.storage.interfaces` module for any class
    that inherits from :class:`Interface <.storage.interfaces.Interface>`  to collect all
    Feature Interfaces and then scans the ``storage.engines.*`` submodules for any class
    that provides an implementation of those features.

    These features, because they all follow the same interface can then be passed on to
    consumers and can be used independent of the underlying storage engine, which is the
    end goal of this module.
